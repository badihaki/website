                Below you will find a small sampling of my writing. I love writing down my ideas into little blog posts. When creating a blog post, 
                I tend to do extra research on the task at hand. Doing so not only helps me convey my ideas and the subject more thoroughly, but 
                also affords me the chance to become a true expert at what I am trying to teach.
